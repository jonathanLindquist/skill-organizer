# Triage Labels

The skills speak in terms of five canonical triage roles. This file maps those roles to the strings used in this repo's issue tracker.

| Label in mattpocock/skills | Obsidian tag         | Kanban color | Meaning                                  |
| -------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `needs-triage`             | `#needs-triage`      | Amber        | Maintainer needs to evaluate this issue  |
| `needs-info`               | `#needs-info`        | Blue         | Waiting on reporter for more information |
| `ready-for-agent`          | `#ready-for-agent`   | Green        | Fully specified, ready for an AFK agent  |
| `ready-for-human`          | `#ready-for-human`   | Purple       | Requires human implementation            |
| `wontfix`                  | `#wontfix`           | Red          | Will not be actioned                     |

When a skill mentions a role, use the corresponding Obsidian tag from this table. In the Obsidian Kanban board, record the tag inside the ticket's `Implementation Data` section.

## Kanban Tag Lines

Use these exact snippets for the ticket's triage line:

```markdown
- Triage: #needs-triage
- Triage: #needs-info
- Triage: #ready-for-agent
- Triage: #ready-for-human
- Triage: #wontfix
```

The colors are configured in the Obsidian Kanban plugin's vault-level `tag-colors` setting, so these tags render consistently across all Kanban boards in the vault.
